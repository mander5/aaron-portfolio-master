        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          I'm a graduate of the University of Bath, where I earned a Masterâ€™s
          degree in Aerospace Engineering.
        </p>
        <p>
          During my studies, I was introduced to programming through MATLAB,
          which sparked a deeper interest in coding. I soon began learning other
          languages like Python and C#, using them to build simple games and
          projects for fun.
        </p>
        <p>
          Eventually, I discovered JavaScript and found that front-end web
          development was a perfect fit. Since then, I've been using JavaScript
          and its ecosystem to build clean, modern websites and web apps.
